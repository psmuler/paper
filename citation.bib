  abstract = {In this paper the mechanical properties of silica aerogels are studied by simulations with the usage of the Movable Cellular Automata (MCA) method. In the MCA approach a sample is considered as a set of interacting cellular automata. The procedure to prepare porous samples is based on random spheres method. The resulting structures have densities in the range from 111 to 2200 kg/m3 and porosity up to 95\%. The structures of the samples are studied by obtaining the fractal dimension using the FD3 program. The Young's modulus is examined in the simulation of a compression test. The elastic modulus relate to density by a power law char\- acterized by exponent 3.83 {$\pm$} 0.18 for samples with densities from 111 to 568 kg/m3 and 3.17 {$\pm$} 0.11 for samples with densities from 350 to 2200 kg/m3. A comparison to previously published data from experiments and comparable computer simulations is included. The results prove that the Movable Cellular Automata method is suitable to investigate the mechanical properties of silica aerogels.},

Model geometry, and the scaling of the elemental diffusivity terms, are based on a Voronoi discretization of the material domain. Steady-state and transient potential flow problems are simulated, and compared with theory, to demonstrate model accuracy and objectivity with respect to lattice random geometry. A novel routine is described for computing moisture flux values at the random lattice sites. Stress production, and potential shrinkage crack development, are driven by the associated drying processes. The random lattice modeling of moisture movement is coupled with rigid-body-spring networks (RBSN), which account for elasticity, creep, and fracture properties of the material. The RBSN is based on the same Voronoi discretization of the material as used to model moisture movement. Relative humidity contours, stress contours, and crack plots are produced for a cement composite overlay restrained by a mature concrete substrate. That example is based on a set of simulation results reported in the literature.},

Increasing the TMOS concentration significantly increases the surface area and Young's modulus while higher VTMS concentration improves hydrophobicity and higher BTSPD concentration leads to increased elastic recovery after compression. Optimized aerogels produced in the study have a combination of high Young's modulus, good hydrophobicity and near complete recovery after compression in agreement with model predictions.},

  abstract = {Silica aerogels are ultralow density materials with nano-sized skeleton network of pores. Their high brittle nature presents a major challenge for mechanical testing and a need exists for novel testing methods. Two new mechanical setups and testing techniques are proposed for measuring the aerogel elastic mechanical properties. Both techniques employ full-field Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for surface deformation measurements. The first setup uses disk compression experiment, known as diametral compression test (Brazilian disk). However, the elastic properties of the material cannot be obtained directly. Instead, an inverse mechanics computational scheme, using both a finite element (FE) model and analytical solution, is proposed. The second direct testing setup is uniaxial compression of rectangular-shaped blocks. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are extracted directly from the experimental stressestrain curves. Our results of tested samples show the relation between the density and the Young's modulus to coincide with previously published trends. The direct and iterative inversemechanics solution methods agree well with each other. The Poisson's ratio is found to be independent of the material apparent density. Comparisons between the two methods and recommendations for expanding the disk testing approach to fracture toughness are discussed.},

In typical concretes, the most significant part of shrinkage is represented by drying shrinkage. Experimental data indicate that the ultimate value of drying shrinkage measured on concrete and mortar specimens is a nonlinear function of the ambient relative humidity. The nonlinear behavior is partially caused by microcracking, and partially by creep of C-S-H gel. On the other hand, drying shrinkage of hardened cement paste, measured on very thin specimens at a gradually decreasing relative humidity, was found to be a linear function of relative humidity. The aim of this paper is to explore whether the nonlinearities observed for macroscopic shrinkage can be explained by finite element simulations at lower levels, starting from the description of the drying cement paste by a viscoelastic model based on the Microprestress-Solidification Theory (MPS) with tensile cracking and with a constant shrinkage ratio.},

Due to their outstanding characteristics, such as extremely low thermal conductivity, low density, high porosity and high specific surface area, they have found excellent potential application for thermal insulation systems in aeronautical/aerospace and earthly domains, for environment clean up and protection, heat storage devices, transparent windows systems, thickening agents in paints, etc. However, native silica aerogels are fragile and sensitive at relatively low stresses, which limit their application. More durable aerogels, with higher strength and stiffness, can be obtained by proper selection of the silane precursors, and constructing the silica inorganic networks by compounding them with different organic polymers or different fiber networks. Recent studies showed that adding flexible organic polymers to the hydroxyl groups on the silica gel surface would be an effective mechanical reinforcing method of silica aerogels. More versatile polymer reinforcement approach can be readily achieved if proper functional groups are introduced on the surface of silica aerogels and then copolymerized with appropriate organic monomers. The mechanical reinforced silica aerogels, with their very open texture, can be an outstanding thermal insulator material for different industrial and aerospace applications.},

  abstract = {The flexible and superhydrophobic properties of silica aerogels are extremely important requirements for their long-term applications. Therefore, the present paper deals with the synthesis and characterization of flexible and superhydrophobic silica aerogels utilizing a two-step acid\textendash base catalyzed sol\textendash gel process with a novel precursor, methyltriethoxysilane (MTES), followed by supercritical drying. Solvent and catalysts used for the synthesis were methanol (MeOH), oxalic acid (C2H2O4) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), respectively. Silica alcosol was prepared by varying the MeOH/MTES molar ratio (S) from 6.45 to 19.35 by keeping the each of oxalic acid (0.001M)/MTES and maintaining a constant ammonium hydroxide (10M)/MTES molar ratio at 4. It was observed that the Young's modulus (Y) decreased from 15.03\texttimes 104 to 3.95\texttimes 104N/m2 with an increase in S value from 6.45 to 19.35. Utilizing constant molar ratio of MeOH/MTES at 19.35, experiments produced monolithic, less shrinkage and flexible aerogels. The effect of various sol\textendash gel parameters such as acid and base catalysts concentration and gel-aging on the flexibility and hydrophobicity of the aerogels were investigated. The aerogels have been characterized by bulk density, percentage of volume shrinkage, Young's modulus, elastic limit measurements, strain energy, Poisson's ratio and contact angle measurements. The microstructural studies were carried out using Transmission Electron Microscopy. The hydrophobicity was confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Aerogels derived from pre-polymerized vinyl trimethoxy silane (VTMS) precursor with nano-size particles are known to exhibit outstanding mechanical and insulation properties. However, the density reduction has been limited by the poor connectivity. This paper presents an innovative technology to generate a new class of VTMS-based hybrid silica aerogels that possess outstanding non-particulate, reticulated structure and superior properties. This technology relies on spinodal decomposition instead of conventionally exploited binodal decomposition, which leads to a particulate structure. This new aerogel technology has significantly increased the void fraction of the pre-polymerized VTMS-based aerogel, which could not be achieved previously using binodal decomposition. The increased void fraction in the form of nano-pores with an average pore size of 21.75 nm nullifies the gas thermal conductivity effectively. Another consequence of the non-particulate structure is decreased processing time by removing the aging step. These improvements are due to the non-particulate structure's increased connectivity produced by spinodal decomposition. This novel structure was then compared to a particulate counterpart aerogel of the same material derived from the conventional binodal decomposition of the prepolymerized VTMS precursor. To further decrease the processing cost, a lower molecular-weight polymeric precursor was synthesized under milder polymerization conditions. The effects of the polymeric precursor's molecular weight on the mechanical and thermal properties of the aerogel created via spinodal decomposition were also investigated.},

Therefore, porosimetry cannot be used to measure the pore size distribution in an aerogel, but it does provide a measure of the bulk modulus of the network. For silica aerogels, the network is linearly elastic under small strains, then exhibits yield followed by densification and plastic hardening. In the plastic regime it is found that the bulk modulus has a power-law dependence on density with an exponent of {$\approx$} 3.2. For the same gels, the linear elastic modulus (before compression) also obeys a power law, but the exponent is {$\backsimeq$} 3.6, as found by several other groups. If a gel is compressed to a pressure, P1, that exceeds the yield stress, then returned to ambient pressure, the plastic deformation is irreversible; if that gel is then compressed to pressure P2 \textquestiondown{} P1, it behaves elastically up to {$\backsimeq$} P1, then yields and follows the same power-law curve. Thus the location of the yield point of a previously compressed material indicates the maximum pressure to which the sample had been subjected; in particular, the compression curve can be used to estimate the capillary pressure exerted on a xerogel during drying.},

No allowance is made for viscoelastic relaxation, so the model applies only for drying from an inert solvent. The model may be used to guide processing efforts to yield either aerogel-like materials with high porosity or xerogels with high density and small pore size for adsorbents, membranes, etc. The extent of shrinkage is governed by two dimensionless parameters, P and m. The quantity P = As {$\gamma$} cos(\texttheta )m{$\rho$}yK0 (where As is specific surface area, {$\gamma$} is surface tension, and \texttheta{} is the contact angle) represents the relative magnitudes of capillary pressure and gel stiffness, and m describes the variation of stiffness with density. For P values less than 1, the shrinkage upon drying is less than 10\%, and is reversible. For shrinkages greater than {$\backsimeq$} 50\%, the density increase is irreversible, and is proportional to P1/(m - 1).

After gelation, the alcogels were dried supercritically by high-temperature solvent extraction. The hydrophobicity of the resulting aerogels was tested by measuring the water uptake by the aerogel as a function of time, after putting them directly on the surface of water. It was found that for M{$<$}0.26 the aerogels were less hydrophobic but more transparent ({$>$}90\% in the visible range), whereas for M{$>$}1.03 the aerogels were more hydrophobic but semi-transparent to opaque. Aerogels that possessed good hydrophobicity and transparency ({$\sim$}85\% in the visible range) were obtained with an M{$\approx$}0.70. An increase in the MTMS content in the gels shifted the pore size distribution towards larger pore radii with a broad distribution. In order to determine the thermal stability of the hydrophobic nature of the aerogels, they were heat-treated in air in the temperature range between 25 and 350\textdegree C. It was found that below 280\textdegree C the aerogel samples showed hydrophobic properties, whereas above 280\textdegree C the hydrophobicity vanished.

It has been observed that the Young's modulus (Y) decreased from 14.11\texttimes 104 to 3.43\texttimes 104~N/m2 with the decrease in the density of the aerogels from 100 to 40 kg/m3. Simultaneously, the aerogels are superhydrophobic with a contact angle as high as 164\textdegree. The superhydrophobic aerogels are thermally stable up to a temperature of 530 K, above which they become hydrophilic. The aerogels have been characterized by bulk density, percentage volume shrinkage, and porosity measurements. The microstructures of the aerogels have been studied using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The Young's modulus of the aerogels has been determined by an uniaxial compression test. The variation of physical properties of the aerogels has been explained by taking into consideration the hydrolysis, condensation reactions, the resulting colloidal clusters and their network formation.},

  abstract = {Repairing materials and interfacial bonding quality are the two crucial factors that affect the shrinkage performance of concrete repair systems. The objective of this paper is to provide a fine meso-scale modelling method of concrete repair systems and to get a better understanding of shrinkage cracks propagation mechanism due to the influence of overlay materials, interface roughness and bonding strength. Through the laser scanning test and different algorithms, e.g. random cutting and random midpoint interpolation algorithm, geometry models of the 2D actual aggregate and rough interfaces with different fractal dimensions were generated. Besides, zero-thickness cohesive elements were inserted in mesh as the reserved path for cracks by modifying the inp file of ABAQUS. The validity of the model was verified by comparing with LI's experiment. Results of the simulation suggested that the final length of surface cracks and interface debonding depended on the overall shrinkage of the repair system and surface cracks mainly occurred in high bonding strength cases; aggregate nearby the interface caused the initial damage at low bonding strength interface, leading to the ``stepped'' debonding with time; The rough interface was more difficult to debond because it required more fracture energy and local shear stress was converted into compressive stress to prevent the development of debonding.},
